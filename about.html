    <div class="info2">Programming feels immediate & concrete, and has direct effect in the world. I'm attracted to
      working on impactful projects that stimulate the user and encourage creative spirit. <br> <br>
      I love having the ability to deeply understand, manipulate, and create systems of technologies that we are able to
      use in our every day lives.</div>
    <div class="info3"> I'm most interested in working on meaningful projects, with team members that are willing to
      push one
      another to elevate our experiences and reach beyond the goals of our projects. <br><br>
